Privacy Policy for QREncryptMeshTAK
Effective Date: February 26, 2026

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application QREncryptMeshTAK for mobile devices. The Application is designed to generate QR codes for use within the Android Team Awareness Kit (ATAK) and focuses on user privacy and data security.

1. Information Collection and Use
QREncryptMeshTAK does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data.

Personal Data: We do not collect "Personally Identifiable Information" (PII) such as your name, email address, physical address, or phone number.

Operational Data: All data processed by the Application (such as text input, encryption keys, or mesh configurations) remains strictly on your local device.

No Transmission: No data entered into the Application is ever transmitted over the internet or any other network by this Application.

2. Permissions
To function correctly, the Application may request certain device permissions. Their use is limited as follows:

Camera: Used solely if the app includes a feature to scan existing QR codes. No images are saved or uploaded.

Storage/Media: Used only if you choose to save a generated QR code image to your device for manual import into ATAK.

3. Third-Party Access
Since the Application does not collect or transmit any data, no third parties have access to your information through this Application. We do not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or cloud storage providers.

4. Data Retention Policy
We do not retain any data. Once the Application is closed or a specific session is cleared, any temporary data used to generate the QR code is wiped from the Application's volatile memory.

5. Children’s Privacy
Our Application does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since no data is collected at all, we are fully compliant with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

6. Security
We value your trust in using QREncryptMeshTAK. Because the Application operates entirely offline, your data is protected from remote interception. However, we remind users that the security of the generated QR codes depends on the physical security of the device and the security protocols of the ATAK environment in which they are used.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any changes are effective immediately upon posting.
